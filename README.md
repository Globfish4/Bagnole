# Bagnole
Bagnole is an educative robotics project. In a team of three we went through every steps of the designing of an autonomous robot.

## Bagnole_Simulation

This directory contains the first part of the project. The objective was to simulate the robot from a CAD model that we worked on in a previous project. To do that we used the simulation software CoppeliaSim. We first used a Client/Server technique to make the simulated robot comunicate with the computer. Then we used a ROS2 for a second version of the simulation.


## Bagnole_Real

This directory contains the second part of the project in which we built the robot and coded different nodes in ROS2 so that the robot can fulfill his mission : make a complete tour of the athletics track.
We did not have time to complete the mission but we managed to code all the nodes needed for its realisation.
