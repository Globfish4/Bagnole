[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:24 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findgpsd_client.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "gpsd_client", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gpsd_client" with
  any of the following names:

    gpsd_clientConfig.cmake
    gpsd_client-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gpsd_client" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gpsd_client_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gpsd_client" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
